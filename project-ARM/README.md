Create a separate variables.json file to store all the configuration values, which can be imported into the template during deployment:
```bash
{
    "vmssName": "phpapp-vmss",
    "instanceCount": 2,
    "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2",
    "adminUsername": "azureuser",
    "adminPasswordOrKey": "YOUR-SSH-KEY-OR-PASSWORD-HERE",
    "authenticationType": "sshPublicKey",
    "customImageId": "/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/your-custom-php-image",
    "mysqlAdminLogin": "mysqladmin",
    "mysqlAdminPassword": "ComplexP@ssw0rd!",
    "mysqlDatabaseName": "phpappdb",
    "applicationGatewayName": "phpapp-gateway"
}
```
Let's also create a deployment script to use this approach:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read variables from variables.json file
VARS_FILE="variables.json"
RG_NAME="my-php-app-rg"
LOCATION="eastus"

# Create resource group
az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION

# Deploy the ARM template with variables
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --template-file azuredeploy.json \
  --debug
```
### Deployment Instructions
1. Update the values in variables.json with your specific configuration:

    - Set your SSH key or password in the adminPasswordOrKey field 
    - Update the customImageId to point to your custom VM image with PHP installed
    - Set secure credentials for MySQL
2. Make the deployment script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
### How this solution works
1. This approach uses variables defined directly in the ARM template
2. You can easily customize deployment values by editing the variables.json file
3. The deployment creates:
    - A stateful VM Scale Set using your custom image
    - A MySQL Flexible Server with private endpoint
    - An Application Gateway to route traffic to the Scale Set
    - A PHP test page that connects to MySQL

      
After deployment completes, you can access your PHP application via the Application Gateway's public IP, which is shown in the deployment outputs.
